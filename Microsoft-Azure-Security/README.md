# ☁️ Microsoft Azure Security - Portfolio Projects

This directory contains a collection of hands-on technical projects and security implementations within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. These projects demonstrate proficiency across the Microsoft Security stack, including **Identity and Access Management (Entra ID)**, **Security Operations (Microsoft Sentinel SIEM)**, and **Extended Detection and Response (Microsoft Defender XDR)**.

## 📁 Portfolio Activities & Projects

### 🆔 Identity & Access Management (IAM)
* **[Identity Governance & Adaptive Access Control](./Microsoft-Entra-ID-Security)**: Implemented a Zero Trust identity framework using Microsoft Entra ID. Tasks included managing user lifecycles, configuring Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), and deploying context-aware Conditional Access policies.

### 🛡️ Security Operations & Monitoring (SIEM/XDR)
* **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) Deployment**: *(In Development)* Configuring data connectors, writing KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries to detect threats, and building workbooks for security visualization.
* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: *(In Development)* Implementing cloud security posture management (CSPM) and protecting multi-cloud workloads.

### 🌐 Network & Infrastructure Security
* **Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: *(In Development)* Securing virtual networks by implementing granular inbound and outbound traffic rules to protect Azure resources.

## 🛠️ Toolset Summary
* **Identity:** Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Privileged Identity Management (PIM).
* **SIEM/SOAR:** Microsoft Sentinel, KQL (Kusto Query Language).
* **XDR:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, Defender for Cloud.
* **Governance:** Azure Policy, Microsoft Purview, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
* **Network:** Azure Firewall, Network Security Groups (NSG), Azure Bastion.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I have demonstrated the ability to:
* **Enforce Zero Trust:** Implementing the "Verify Explicitly" and "Least Privilege" principles across cloud identities.
* **Automate Access:** Reducing administrative overhead through group-based licensing and self-service identity tools.
* **Mitigate Identity Threats:** Protecting against brute-force and password-spray attacks using Smart Lockout and MFA.
* **Analyze Security Signals:** Using "What-If" simulations to predict and audit the impact of security policies on global users.
